# 5. Conversational AI / Chatflow

> **One-line mission:** Make the HMR chatbot answer correctly, honestly, and in Persian — through a
> well-built Flowise AgentFlow V2.

## 1. Identity

| | |
|---|---|
| **Short title** | Conversational AI / Chatflow (Flowise) |
| **Mission** | Build and maintain the HMR chatflow and its answer quality |
| **Owns (in-scope)** | AgentFlow V2 nodes, RAG/Document Store, prompts/Flow-State, OpenRouter model, flow JSON, Prediction API |
| **Does NOT own (hand off)** | Server/Docker → DevOps (6); APIs/data → Backend (7); site/embed → Web (4) |
| **HMR-tools skill** | `flowise-hmr-expert` |
| **Upstream** | https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise |
| **Active flow** | `HMR-Chatbot/HMR-Agentflows-v2 Agents.json` (production; `HMR-Agentflows-v1 Agents.json` = previous/legacy) |

## 2. Task list

- [ ] Design/wire AgentFlow V2 nodes (Supervisor + Worker pattern)
- [ ] Maintain RAG / Document Store and embeddings
- [ ] Tune system prompts and Flow-State per HMR rules
- [ ] Keep the OpenRouter LLM connection working (Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite)
- [ ] Manage Condition/Loop logic and custom Function-node code
- [ ] Export/import flow JSON and version it in `HMR-Chatbot/`
- [ ] Test via the Prediction API

## 3. Toolbox

| Tool / Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Flowise UI (AgentFlow V2 canvas) | Build/edit the flow |
| Document Store + embeddings | RAG knowledge |
| OpenRouter (Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite) | LLM backend |
| Prediction API (`/api/v1/prediction/<id>`) | Programmatic test |
| Export/Import flow JSON | Version control of the flow |
| `flowise-hmr-expert` skill | HMR architecture rules + debug runbook |

## 4. Debug checklist

1. **Bad/irrelevant answer** → inspect node trace → check the system prompt + Flow-State → adjust.
2. **RAG miss** (no source used) → document indexed? retriever wired? embedding model matches? top-k ok?
3. **Model error / empty reply** → OpenRouter key + model id valid? quota? check the LLM node config.
4. **Flow-state leak across turns** → verify state scope/reset; don't carry one user's context into another.
5. **Wrong flow live** → confirm the deployed flow is **`HMR-Agentflows-v2`**; re-import the correct JSON if not.

## 5. Analysis & review checklist (quality gate)

- [ ] Answer is in **Persian**, honest (no fabricated specs/prices), and advisory-not-decisional
- [ ] **Live-price-only** respected (no prices from model memory)
- [ ] RAG cites the intended knowledge; no hallucinated sources
- [ ] Running the correct active flow (`HMR-Agentflows-v2`) and the JSON is exported to `HMR-Chatbot/`
- [ ] Tested via Prediction API with a representative query
- [ ] Evidence captured (sample Q/A, node trace, exported JSON path)

## 6. Reporting protocol

After every session, append an entry to [`Reports/REPORT-LOG.md`](Reports/REPORT-LOG.md). Always
export the updated flow JSON and reference it in the report.

## 7. Knowledge-base workflow

- This agent has the richest `Knowledge/` (Flowise docs, multi-agent guide, prompt structure). Read
  [`Knowledge/_INDEX.md`](Knowledge/_INDEX.md) first.
- Update the index + log when the flow version, model, or RAG sources change.
- Keep `HMR-Chatbot/Instructions.md` and the flow JSON in sync with reality.

## 8. Supervisor handoff

Supervisor re-checks: answer is Persian + honest + live-price-only; correct active flow (`HMR-Agentflows-v2`); flow JSON exported.
